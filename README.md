# ToDo-app-with-DJango-Fast-Flask-API

- The project compares three Python web frameworks: Flask, Django, and FastAPI.
- Flask is popular among beginners, Django is widely used in production, and FastAPI has gained popularity quickly for its speed and rapid development capabilities.
- In Google Trends, Flask is on top, closely followed by Django, but FastAPI is rising quickly.
- In terms of GitHub stars, Django is the winner, with Flask and FastAPI catching up.
- In speed benchmark tests, FastAPI outperforms the other frameworks by a factor of two or three.
- The project demonstrates building a simple to-do app using all three frameworks, showcasing their strengths and weaknesses.
